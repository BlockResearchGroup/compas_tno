    Parameters
    ----------
    form : ::FormDiagram::
        Form diagram to compute the stiffness.
    lengths : array (m x 1)
        The lengths considered in each edge.
        The default value is ``None`` in which case the initial lengths are calculated based on the middle surface.
    area : float
        The constant area applied to each edge.
        The default value is ``0.125`` which corresponds to a square section of 0.25 x 0.25 m.
    E : float
        The young modulus of the material.
        The default value is ``20E+6`` which corresponds to a 20 GPa commonly used for concrete.

    Returns
    -------
    k : array (m x 1)
        The stiffness of each edge.

    Note
    -------
    The stiffness is based on a the formula below:
